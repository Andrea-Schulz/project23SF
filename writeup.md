# Project Writeup - Sensor Fusion

## Mid-term Project: 3D Object Detection

use the viewer to locate and closely inspect point-clouds on vehicles and write a short report that includes the following items:

### Evaluation
Find and display 10 examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud

####  Vehicle Features
Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles (e.g. rear-bumper, tail-lights) and describe them briefly.

Also, use the range image viewer from the last example to underpin your findings using the lidar intensity channel.

You may also add any additional discussion and visualizations to your write-up as desired.

#### Object Detection Performance
You may also consider adding in your performance metrics, but that is not required.

## Final Project 

### 1. Tracking Steps
Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion).
* Which results did you achieve?
* Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?

### 2. Comparison
Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 

### 3. Challenges
* Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios?
* Did you see any of these challenges in the project?

### 4. Improvements
* Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
